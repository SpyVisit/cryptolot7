# cryptolot7
This code simulates a crypto lottery with a negligible chance of guessing private keys from abandoned Bitcoin addresses. Written in C++ for Arduino, it generates private and public keys, encodes them into Bitcoin addresses, and checks for associated values. LEDs provide visual feedback, serving as an educational tool for cryptography.
